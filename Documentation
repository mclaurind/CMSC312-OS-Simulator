Phase 1 11/02
Description
This project currently simulates an operating system. The program asks for the user to enter a program to run and the number of processes
it should jave. The OS will parse the program file to generate the user-defined number of processes. OS will then allocate the all processes  
to the new queue and then to the ready queue. From there, processeses will be evaluated by the scheduler, through the round robin scheduling algorithm, and sent
back and forth between the waiting and ready queues depending on instruction type: calculate or I/O. Instructions will run for a randomized amount of cycles.

How to Run: 
From the jar file or being compiled and executed manually through the command line.
*choose program Calculator as there are a few bugs with critical sections.

Issues:
1. critical section resoulution not implemented fully
2. round robin scheduler has some issues when preempting some processes and 
3. UI's visuals could be improved
